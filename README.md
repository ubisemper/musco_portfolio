### Portfolio
For this portfolio i would like to look at several albums from Nina Kravis
She is a techno focussed artist, but within this genre she plays alot. And there is alot of variation within the music
The corpus i am going to look at the first 3 albums she released, the middle three and the last three. It would be intresting to see how her style has transformed. And if there is a clear change in her style whenm covid came along. Maybe this had an affect on the dancibilty or other factors sucs as BPM.

Some music is not released on spotify but is on soundlcoud. Also an importand factor to think about. Is that when she play's live music, new music is created but this might not be recored.

There are a few iconic songs from nina Kravis such as "i'm weak" amd a later release "skyscraper. These would be intresting to look at, because they significantly differ in style.
